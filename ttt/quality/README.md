# Example
You want to make a suite of card games (poker, blackjack, etc.). 
You realize that you will have some common requirements when it comes to card, e.g.
	- how to express cards as objects
	- how to express a deck of cards as an object
	- shuffling a deck of cards
	- dealing from a deck of cards
	- how to express a hand of cards as an object
